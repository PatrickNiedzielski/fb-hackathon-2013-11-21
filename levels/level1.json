["water", "Welcome to <b>Learn Python!</b>, an interactive and cooperative online game for learning the basics of the Python programming language with a friend.  Each line in Python is called a <i>statement</i>, like in English, and the statements themselves are arranged similarly to English's, too.  Here's an example of a Python statement that you can use here to say something to your friend: <code>self.say(\"Hello!\")</code>  The first part, <code>self</code>, is the subject of the statement, the thing in your program which does the action.  In Python, this and other actors are called objects, and this object represents your character on the screen!  Next, after the dot, is the verb of the statement&mdash;or in Python terms, the <i>method</i>.  Inside the parentheses is the direct object of the sentence, which Python programmers call <i>arguments</i>.  Try introducing yourself to your friend, and see what happens."]]
