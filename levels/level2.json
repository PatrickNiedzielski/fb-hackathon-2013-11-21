["water", "Now that you can move around, you’ll want to remember some of the things you see.  For instance, the signs there have a message we want you to say, but you have to read it first, and then remember it.  You can store things like numbers and text (called strings) in <i>variables</i>.  To use a variable, just assign a value to a name, like <code>mynum = 5</code>.  Now mynum has remembered the number five for later.  Objects can also have variables.  The signs on the screen have a <i>text</i> variable unique to each sign.  If you’re facing the sign, you can call the <code>get_in_front()</code> method to reference the sign object, and then add a dot and the word <i>text</i> at the end to reference its text.  (Just like the methods that began with <code>move_</code>, you can use <code>turn_left</code>,<code> turn_right</code>, <code>turn_up</code>, and <code>turn_down</code> to change which direction you’re facing.)  Tell your friend what a sign says."]]
